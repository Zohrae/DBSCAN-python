The Clustering Visualizer is a PyQt5-based application designed for data clustering analysis. It offers interactive features for uploading data, selecting dimensions, and visualizing clusters generated by DBSCAN and KMeans algorithms. Users can explore clustering results in 2D or 3D, adjust clustering parameters, and gain insights through graphical representations. This project empowers users to efficiently analyze and interpret clustering outcomes for various datasets.
